# url-redirector

A Clojure library designed to manage URL redirection using data from a JSON document stored in MongoDB.

## What redirections are supported?

# Original Domain -> New Domain redirection

foo.com -> bar.com

# Original Domain -> New Domain + path redirection

foo.com -> bar.com/place/index.html

# Response: HTTP 301

The library maps the original domain, transforms as appropriate and returns the new URL via HTTP 301

The meaning of HTTP 301 is Moved Permanently. The semantics of this must fit your needs if you wish to use this library.

The detailed semantics of HTTP 301 is explained in [more detail on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301)

Specifically, 301 is recommended by Google to change the URL of a page as it is shown in search engine results.

## Usage

A JSON document is used to define the transformations that are required. The document requires two objects with 
the same structure: source-domain and target-domain. The table lists the supported properties:

| Property      | Type    | Values          | Required?  | Default Value |
| --------      | ------- | --------------- | --------   | ------------- |
| scheme        | string  | http or https   | No         | "http"        |
| domain        | string  | domain name     | Yes        | None          |
| domain        | string  | domain name     | Yes        | None          |
| port          | number  | valid HTTP/S port | No       | None          |
| path          | string  | resource path     | No       | None          |

# Example 1: Domain redirection

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com"
  }
}
```

# Example 2: Domain + path redirection

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "path": "/new/path"
  }
}
```

# Example 3: All options in use

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "scheme" : "http",
    "domain": "foo.com",
    "port": 8080,
    "path": "/old/path"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "scheme" : "https",
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "port": 553,
    "path": "/new/path"
  }
}
```
