# url-redirector

A Clojure application designed to manage URL redirection using data from a JSON document stored in MongoDB and cached in REDIS.

### Response: HTTP 301

The library maps the original domain, transforms as appropriate and returns the new URL via HTTP 301

The meaning of HTTP 301 is Moved Permanently. The semantics of this must fit your needs if you wish to use this library.

The detailed semantics of HTTP 301 is explained in [more detail on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301)

Specifically, 301 is recommended by Google to change the URL of a page as it is shown in search engine results.

## What redirections are supported?

#### This Domain / path -> New Domain / path redirection

this.com/foo/bar -> that.com/foo/bar

TBD... paste in example output

#### Another Domain -> New Domain redirection

foo.com -> bar.com

TBD... paste in example output

#### Another Domain -> New Domain + path redirection

foo.com -> bar.com/place/index.html

TBD... paste in example output

## Networking pre-requisites

Assuming that foo.com is not this domain, the DNS CNAME for foo.com must point to the domain of this app. Depending on where 
and how you host the app, using DNS A records is possible but more fragile.

## Usage

A JSON document is used to define the transformations that are required. The document requires two objects with 
the same structure: source-domain and target-domain. The table lists the supported properties:

| Property      | Type    | Values          | Required?  | Default Value |
| --------      | ------- | --------------- | --------   | ------------- |
| scheme        | string  | http or https   | No         | "http"        |
| domain        | string  | domain name     | No         | Current domain |
| port          | number  | valid HTTP/S port | No       | None          |
| path          | string  | resource path     | No       | None          |
| operations    | object  | see other table | No         | None          |

A set of operations are supported to mutate the path. The mutation operations are one of `prepend`, `append`, `regex` or `drop`

The operations `prepend`, `append`, `regex` options take a string value that will be applied.

The drop operation has two more specific properties:

| Property      | Type    | Values                       | Required?  | Default Value |
| --------      | ------- | ---------------------------- | --------   | ------------- |
| location      | string  | first, last or nth           | Yes        | first         |
| count         | number  | number of path elements to drop | Yes     | 0             |


## Performance

By default the application has a maximum response time of 500ms, after which it will return a HTTP status 202

## Limitations

In the existing design, no attempt is made to validate the transformed URLs.

## Notes for PAAS platforms (for example Heroku)

### Heroku

The source domain must be added to the list of domains supported by the application. 

This function is *NOT* provided by this application.

## Dependencies

You need to install locally or have network services that provide MongoDB and REDIS.

The application will attach to these services using the following variables / defaults
 
| Name          | Default Value |
| --------      | ------------- |
| MONGO_URL     | mongodb://localhost/test |
| REDIS_URL     | 127.0.0.1:6379 |

## Options

You can tweak the application behaviour with a small number of options

| Name          | Meaning          | Default Value |
| --------      | -------          | ------------- |
| PORT | Port # for exposed HTTP endpoint | 5000 |
| MONGO_COLLECTION  | Document collection name | redirections |
| REDIS_TTL_SECONDS | # Seconds REDIS caches values | 30 |
| SLA_MILLISECONDS | # Milliseconds before SLA fails (HTTP 202 response) | 500 |

## Examples

###### Example 1: Path redirection

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "path": "/google"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "www.google.com"
  }
}
```

###### Example 1: Domain redirection

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com"
  }
}
```

###### Example 2: Domain + path redirection

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "path": "/new/path"
  }
}
```

###### Example 3: All domain and path redirections options (without path transformations)

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "scheme" : "http",
    "domain": "foo.com",
    "port": 8080,
    "path": "/old/path"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "scheme" : "https",
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "port": 553,
    "path": "/new/path"
  }
}
```

###### Example 3: Path transformations - prepend

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com",
    "path": "/old/path"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "operations": {
      "prepend" : "/something/at/the/start/"
    }
  }
}
```

###### Example 3: Path transformations - append

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com",
    "path": "/old/path"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "operations": {
      "append" : "/something/at/the/end"
    }
  }
}
```

## TODO: Regex example
###### Example 3: Path transformations - regex

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com",
    "path": "/old/path"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "operations": {
      "regex" : "TDB"
    }
  }
}
```

###### Example 3: Path transformations - drop 2 elements from the start of the path

```JavaScript
{
  "source-domain": {
    "domain": "foo.com",
    "path": "/will-be/dropped/old/path"
  },
  "target-domain": {
    "domain": "bar.com",
    "operations": {
      "drop" : "start",
      "count" : 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

The application comes with a number of pre-built tests to ensure that the general logic is valid.

To confirm, you can run inspect the tests and run them with 'lein test'

Please extend the test suite with your specific needs.

## Pull requests

I will accept pull requests for the core logic and especially for any new tests.

## FAQ

### Why not just support hard coded regex?

This application supports regexes where they are most commonly applied (to mutate path values). 

The major advantage of this application is that the data is managed in MongoDB and so the application does not need to 
be restarted or interrupted in anyway to maintain route data.

The non regex options are provided for the people who are more comfortable with simple options rather than the more 
magical regexes.

### Is it possible to use this application as a reverse proxy?

No. That's another, much more complex use case.
